# Clone of Digital Representations of Tree Species Range Maps from "Atlas of United States Trees" by Elbert L. Little, Jr. (and other publications)

This repository contains a clone of the shapefiles and metadata for tree species ranges in the United States that were formerly available from the USGS at https://gec.cr.usgs.gov/data/little/. The data were removed in the spring/summer of 2017.

The source data for this repo come from an archived copy of the website from 27 January 2017 available at: https://web.archive.org/web/20170127093428/https://gec.cr.usgs.gov/data/little/ 

PDFs of the range maps are not available in this repo, but may be found on the archived website.

ZIP'd shapefiles were unzipped and grouped into subfolders in the SHP/ directory following the original file naming convention.
